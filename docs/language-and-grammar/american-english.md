WellnessLiving content uses American English as our documentation standard. Because American and British English differ in spelling, punctuation, formatting, and vocabulary, use the following guidelines to help ensure consistency.

## Spelling conventions
Use American English spellings consistently, particularly for common differences:
* ✅ (good) color, behavior, canceled, authorization, organization, center
* ❌ (bad) colour, behaviour, cancelled, authorisation, organisation, centre

## Punctuation usage
Adopt American punctuation standards, such as periods and commas placed inside quotation marks:
* ✅ (good) Click "Start," then select the first option.
* ❌ (bad) Click "Start", then select the first option.

## Vocabulary preferences
Use vocabulary common in American English, avoiding British variants:
* ✅ (good) elevator, apartment, check, vacation
* ❌ (bad) lift, flat, cheque, holiday
