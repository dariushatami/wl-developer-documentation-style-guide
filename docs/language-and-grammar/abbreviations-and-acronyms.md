Abbreviations and acronyms should be treated on a case-by-case basis. In most cases where they’re commonly used, it’s advisable to use them.

When using an acronym for the first time, spell out the full term and include the abbreviation or acronym in parentheses. For example:
* Application-Layer Protocol Control Information (APCI)
* Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)

However, there are many cases where acronyms that are widely understood by developers (e.g., API) **shouldn’t be spelled out** because doing so would add unnecessary verbosity without improving clarity. These acronyms are so commonly used across developer communities that spelling them out can feel pedantic or disrupt the natural flow of technical writing.

In some cases, acronyms could be introduced, but they should be avoided. This is especially true for many of WellnessLiving’s branded apps, components, and features. For example, the Elevate Staff App should not be acronymized as “ESA.”

Some common developer terms have both a long version and a short version. For example, it’s common to say app or demo instead of application or demonstration. These shortened terms aren’t considered abbreviations and shouldn’t include periods.

If a long word is commonly used in both writing and speech, prefer that version and avoid unnatural abbreviations (e.g., estimate is more widely used than est).
