Formatting is a visual syntax layer in developer documentation, acting like punctuation. It directs the reader’s attention to priority terms and interactive elements.

## Bold (strong emphasis)
Apply to UI controls, buttons, and field labels that appear visually bold in the interface. Don't bold full sentences.
* ✅ Click **Run** report to generate the data set.

## Italic (emphasis)
Use sparingly for introducing terminology or clarifying meaning in context.
* ✅ The *refresh token* allows you to obtain a new access token without re-authenticating.

## Monospace (code formatting)
Use backticks (`) for inline code elements and fenced code blocks for multi-line examples. Apply to code, API parameters, CLI commands, JSON keys, file paths, and keyboard input.
* ✅ Set `"session_timeout": 300` in `config.json`.
