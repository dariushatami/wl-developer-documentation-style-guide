Use precise and conventional prepositions to express relationships between concepts clearly. In developer documentation, prepositions often signal data flow, dependencies, or system behavior, so accuracy is critical.

* ✅ Connect **to** the API  
* ✅ Save the report **in** PDF format  
* ✅ Set the duration **for** the session  
* ❌ Connect **with** the API  
* ❌ Save the report **as** PDF  
* ❌ Set the duration **of** the session

Choose prepositions based on idiomatic technical usage, not casual phrasing. Favor verbs and prepositions that reflect widely accepted industry patterns.

It’s also perfectly acceptable to end a sentence with a preposition when it improves clarity or avoids awkward constructions. This often happens in questions, passives, or relative clauses, and forcing the preposition elsewhere can make the sentence sound unnatural.

* ✅ Which API should I authenticate **with**?  
* ✅ Here’s the file format the system will export **to**.  
* ❌ With which API should I authenticate?  
* ❌ Here’s the file format **to** which the system will export.

This is a common misconception inherited from overly formal writing rules. In modern technical documentation, natural phrasing takes precedence over rigid prescriptive grammar, especially when addressing developers.

!!! note "Common verb + preposition pairings"
Technical writers should use industry-standard pairings, especially when describing tasks like integration, configuration, or system behavior. Some common examples include:

```
- authenticate **with**  
- send **to**  
- receive **from**  
- map **to**  
- listen **for**  
- save **in**  
- export **to**  
- depend **on**  
- write **to**  
- read **from**

When in doubt, check usage in API documentation from established platforms (e.g., Stripe, GitHub, Twilio) to ensure consistency with developer expectations.
