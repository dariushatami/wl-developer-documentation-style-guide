Use contractions wherever possible to create a friendly, conversational tone in developer-facing documentation. This includes tutorials, help articles, guides, and most general-purpose content.

Contractions help build a more approachable voice, especially when explaining complex or intimidating concepts. They also improve readability by mirroring how people speak and think.

## Exceptions
Avoid contractions in cases where tone, clarity, or seriousness take precedence:
* High-risk warnings or instructions  
    * ✅ (good) Do not run this endpoint unless you have backed up all your report data.  
    * ❌ (bad) Don’t run this endpoint unless you’ve backed up all your report data.  
* Legal, contractual, or policy language  
    * ✅ (good) WellnessLiving is not responsible and cannot be held liable for loss of data resulting from data merge operations.  
    * ❌ (bad) WellnessLiving isn’t responsible and can’t be held liable for loss of data resulting from data merge operations.

Contractions may also be avoided in titles, table headers, or error messages, depending on space and tone. Use your judgment and favor consistency within a document or module.
