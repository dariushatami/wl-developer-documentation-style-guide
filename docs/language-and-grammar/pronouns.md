Pronouns should be chosen to maintain clarity, inclusivity, and a direct connection with the reader. In technical documentation, they influence tone, accessibility, and grammatical precision.

## Second-person pronouns
Default to second person (“you”) for instructions and explanatory content. This point of view speaks directly to the reader, improving clarity and engagement (see Point of view for more on second-person usage). Use gender-neutral forms when the second person isn't practical (e.g, when referring to a third-party solution).

* ✅ (good) If a new integration partner requests access, they must complete the security questionnaire before you grant permissions.  
* ❌ (bad) If a new integration partner requests access, you must complete the security questionnaire before granting permissions.

## Gender-neutral pronouns
When using third-person pronouns, avoid gender-specific forms (he, she) unless referring to a specific, identified person. Use they/them/their for singular and plural references to avoid unnecessary gendering.

* ✅ (good) The developer must download the file to their local machine.  
* ❌ (bad) The developer must download the file to her local machine.

## Relative pronouns
Use relative pronouns (that, which, who) when they clarify the relationship between a noun and its clause. Omitting them can make sentences ambiguous or harder to parse, especially in complex technical contexts.
