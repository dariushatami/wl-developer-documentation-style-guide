WellnessLiving documentation should use imperial units as the default, with metric equivalents added when appropriate for clarity, localization, or global accessibility.

## General guidance
Use imperial units (inches, pounds, miles, Fahrenheit, etc.) as the primary format. Include metric equivalents in parentheses for content appearing in help articles or public-facing tutorials:  
* ✅ (good) 72 inches (183 cm)
* ✅ (good) 100 lbs (45 kg)
* ❌ (bad) 183 cm (72 inches)

## Formatting and spacing
Use numerals (not words) with unit abbreviations:  
* ✅ (good) 10 lbs, 6 ft, 15 cm
* ❌ (bad) ten pounds, six feet, fifteen centimeters

Add a space between the number and the unit:
* ✅ (good) 25 in
* ❌ (bad) 25in

Do not include periods after unit abbreviations:
* ✅ (good) 12 km
* ❌ (bad) 12 km.

## Temperature
Express temperature using the Fahrenheit scale unless clearly intended for a global or scientific context:
* ✅ 68°F
* ❌ 20°C (unless shown as a secondary)
