Use a bulleted list for items that share a common theme or category but donâ€™t need to appear in a specific order. This helps readers scan related concepts quickly without implying sequence.

**Guidelines:**
* Begin each bullet with the same part of speech (e.g., all verbs or all nouns).  
* Use sentence case for each bullet item.  
* Omit terminal punctuation for fragments; use periods for full sentences.  
* Introduce the list with a complete sentence ending in a colon.

**Example:**
