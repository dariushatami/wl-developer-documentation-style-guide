Use clear writing and plain language principles.

Clear writing relies on the following principles:

* A focus on the reader
* Clear ideas with sound logic
* Active voice over passive voice, with some exceptions
* Specific information relevant to the topic at hand
* Short sentences, simple words, and common terms (no run-on sentences or complicated jargon)
* Direct points (no muddiness or confusion)
* Proper organization and use of headings, lists, and tables where appropriate
