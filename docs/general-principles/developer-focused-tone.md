Write like a developer guiding another developer through building, integrating, or extending WellnessLiving. Clarity and utility matter more than marketing polish.

**Do:**

* Use concise, plain language.
* Focus on what the user needs to do.
* Show code before sharingmk theory.

Assume technical competence and don’t over-explain the obvious.

**Don’t:**

* Use jargon for the sake of it.
* Add fluff or filler to “sound professional.”
* Use sales or promotional language.

**Example:**

✅ “Use GET /users/:id to fetch a specific user.”

❌ “This powerful endpoint empowers you to seamlessly retrieve user information!”
