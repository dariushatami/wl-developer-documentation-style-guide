Documentation must reflect the actual behavior, capabilities, and limitations of the product as it exists. Inaccurate or outdated information undermines user trust, increases support overhead, and can lead to serious implementation errors.

To ensure technical accuracy:

* Verify all descriptions, parameters, and examples against the current product version or API.
* Consult subject-matter experts when in doubt.
* Avoid guessing, assuming, or extrapolating functionality.
* Regularly audit content after feature updates or releases.
