Semantic tags are important search helpers that can shape how readers filter, explore, and navigate documentation. Tags should reinforce the content’s relevance to specific audiences and tasks.

Use tagging to support intelligent filtering and progressive discovery.

## Focus on reader perspective
Tags should reflect:
* What the reader is trying to do (e.g., `authentication`, `escalation`)
* What role they’re in (e.g., `devops-engineer`, `llm-engineer`)
* What system or module they’re working with (e.g., `voicebot`, `client-records`)

## Use tags to drive cross-linking and related content
Tags can power “Related articles,” landing pages, and filtered views.

For example, `warm-handoff` may aggregate:
* Tutorials
* Reference endpoints
* NLP agent patterns

## Combine tags for intersectional discovery
YAML example:
``` yaml
tags:
  - nlp
  - api
  - call-flow
  - support-engineer
```

This enables readers to filter by both technology and role context.
