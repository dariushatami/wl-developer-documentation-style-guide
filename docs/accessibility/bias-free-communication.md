Our documentation should be inclusive and respectful of all developers. Use language that welcomes every person's background or identity.

**Do:**

* Use gender-neutral language
* Refer to roles, not stereotypes
* Avoid idioms or cultural references that may not translate globally
* Use person-first language where appropriate (e.g., “a person with a disability”)
* Default to professional and respectful terms

**Don’t:**

* Use gendered pronouns unnecessarily
* Refer to things like age, ethnicity, religion, or identity unless technically required
* Use humor or sarcasm that could confuse or alienate anyone
