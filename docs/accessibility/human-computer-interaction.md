Documentation is a critical part of the developerâ€™s problem-solving loop. Aim to reduce friction, lower cognitive load, and keep readers in a productive state of flow.

How to apply HCI principles in docs:

* Chunk information: Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs to prevent overload.
* Progressively disclose complexity: Start with simple use cases, then layer in edge cases or configuration options.
* Minimize ambiguity: Use precise terminology and consistent phrasing to prevent second-guessing.
* Enable fast scanning: Use consistent formatting for classes, methods, and code blocks so users can quickly locate what they need.
