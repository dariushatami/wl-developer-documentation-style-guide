Developer documentation should be technically accurate and easy to read. Writing for humans means expressing complex ideas in clear, straightforward language without diluting technical precision.

Make your content human-readable by:

* Using short sentences and paragraphs.
* Avoiding jargon.
* Writing in active voice whenever possible.
* Explaining acronyms on first use.
* Using consistent terminology and phrasing throughout.
