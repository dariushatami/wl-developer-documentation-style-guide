Search engines (including our own site search) rely on keywords, hierarchy, and clarity to index and surface content. Well-written, scannable text helps developers find what they need faster.

Use the following strategies to improve your documentation’s searchability.

## Use plain language in headings and body text
* Favor common terms developers will search for (e.g., “Cancel a Class,” not “Reverse Enrollment”).
* Don’t invent terminology where standard terms exist (e.g., use “authentication token,” not “session badge”).

## Link consistently
* Use descriptive, repeatable link labels (e.g., “See the Class booking API reference,” not “click here”).
* Cross-link to related pages using their titles, not vague phrases.

For example:
* ✅ **Good:** Learn more in the [Class booking API Reference](...).
* ❌ **Bad:**: For more info, [click here](...).

## Avoid unnecessary synonyms
* Standardize naming for recurring concepts:
    * “API key” (not “access code”)
    * “Class” (not “session” or “program”)
    * “Voice agent” (not “bot” or “concierge” unless contextually required)
