Ensure all cross-references to classes, constants, and secondary endpoints are functional.

Best practices:

* Always link to source definitions (e.g., class reference, API endpoint page) when mentioned.
* Prefer direct links over vague phrases like “see above” or “as mentioned earlier.”
* Use consistent naming and casing.
* Test internal anchor links and ensure they aren’t broken by future structural changes.
* For cross-language SDKs or platform variations, link to language-specific references when applicable.
