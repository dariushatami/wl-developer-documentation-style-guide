Developer documentation should be accessible to a global audience. Design content and code examples that work across languages, regions, and cultural contexts.

!!! note "Localized Style Protocols in This Guide"

    While this guide emphasizes writing for a global audience, some conventions are intentionally localized to WellnessLiving's primary audience. For example, all documentation should use American English, imperial measurements where applicable, and culturally neutral but North Americaâ€“centric examples unless otherwise specified.

    When writing content meant to be localized or translated, be mindful of these default choices that aren't global norms and may need to be adapted for international versions of the documentation.

## Writing for global audiences
* Avoid slang and cultural references
* Use simple, direct language that translates well
* Explain context that may be unfamiliar to international readers
* Choose universal examples over region-specific ones

## Technical terminology
* Define acronyms and technical terms on first use
* Reference the [WellnessLiving Glossary](https://help.wellnessliving.com/en/articles/9708089-wellnessliving-glossary) as the source of technical truth
* Use standard industry terminology rather than internal jargon

## Content structure for translation
* Use clear, hierarchical headings that translate well
* Keep sentences concise and avoid complex compound structures
* Write self-contained paragraphs that can be reordered if needed
* Use consistent terminology

## Regional variations
* Document API behavior differences across regions (e.g., GDPR compliance, data residency)
* Include examples for different WellnessLiving tiers (e.g., Starter vs. Enterprise)
* Address time zone and date format variations in tutorials
* Consider legal and regulatory differences in implementation guides

## Translation preparation
* Structure content with clear, translatable units
* Use meaningful link text that works in any language
* Provide context for UI elements and button names
* Include screenshots with callouts that can be easily localized

## Code examples and data formats
* Use ISO standards for dates (YYYY-MM-DD), times (24-hour format), and currencies
* Include locale-aware examples in API documentation:
  ```json
  {
    "appointment_time": "2024-03-15T14:30:00Z",
    "price": {"amount": 2500, "currency": "USD"},
    "locale": "en-US"
  }

* Avoid hardcoded English strings in code samples
* Document time zone handling and locale-specific formatting

## Cultural considerations
* Use diverse names in examples
* Include varied business scenarios (e.g., different payment methods, regional regulations)
* Test documentation layout with longer translated text

## Writing for global audiences
* Avoid idioms, slang, and cultural references that are difficult for international readers to understand
* Use simple, direct language that translates well
* Choose universal examples over region-specific ones

## Content design principles
* Write in clear, simple English that reduces translation complexity
* Use active voice and direct instructions
* Avoid region-specific assumptions (e.g., business hours, holidays, payment methods)
* Structure content with consistent patterns that translate well

## Technical considerations
* Use UTF-8 encoding for all text content
* Design layouts that accommodate text expansion (25-30% longer in translation)
* Include locale-aware code examples:

  ```python
  # Good: Locale-aware formatting
  formatted_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
  
  # Better: Include time zone and locale context
  user_locale = request.headers.get('Accept-Language', 'en-US')
  formatted_date = format_date_for_locale(datetime.now(), user_locale)

## Validation and testing
* Review content with non-native English speakers
* Test translated versions with actual users from target regions
* Use tools like Google Translate to identify overly complex sentences
* Maintain translation memory for consistent terminology across updates
