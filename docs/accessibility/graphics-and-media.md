Provide alt text for all graphics and media included as part of any document or webpage. Good alt text will tell an end user not just what the image is, but how and why the image relates to the content of the document or webpage. When drafting alt text, consider the following:

* Can the alt text be deciphered easily by a screen reader?
* Can the alt text be used effectively for search engine indexing?
* Is the alt text an appropriate replacement if the graphic or media fails to load properly?
